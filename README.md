**SimpleAutoDiff.jl** is [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package, which implements simple forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD). It is not
meant to be the most performant implementation, but rather focusses on simplicity and readability of the code. It only implements the core features
of AD without claiming optimal performance and flexibility. Therefore, it is a good starting point to understand or teach automatic/algorithmic
differentiation, but is not the perfect choice for production use. For alternative packages performing AD, see the list in https://juliadiff.org/.
